                    <i>Thirty years after the events of Blade Runner (1982), a new Blade Runner, L.A.P.D. Officer "K" (Ryan Gosling), 
                    unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos. 
                    K's discovery leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), 
                    a former L.A.P.D. Blade Runner, who has been missing for thirty years.</i>
                    <br>
                    Even if it's often overlooked by the general audience, this movie is one of my favourites. Mostly famed for it's 
                    breathtaking visuals, <i>Blade runner 2049</i> has an incredible story and great performances. Even though it has 
                    a running time of 2 hours and 44 minutes, you definitely won't be bored. But before watching this movie, you should
                    know that this is a sequel to <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3">Blade Runner(1982)</a></i>.

                <br>
                Beautiful and surreal, this is a movie everyone should see at least once. Make some popcorn, 
                take a blanket, sit on the couch and enjoy 2 hours of a beautiful animation, interesting
                story and great characters.

                <br>
                Emotional and smart, this movie really is an unforgetable experience. With an awesome story and breathtaking imagery, it makes you
                feel like you've been in space with the characters. It has great performances, script and direction, but by far the best part is Hans 
                Zimmer's music. A film for all ages.
