                <i>A modern update finds the famous sleuth and his doctor partner solving crime in 21st century London.</i>
                <br>
                A smart and fresh take on the classic story. A great adaptation which translated the characters into modern age superbly.
                The story will have you hooked from the start and it's great that you don't need to know anything about the source 
                material to understand it. It's a unique show well worth watching.
                <br>

                <i>A family saga with a supernatural twist, set in a German town, where the disappearance 
                of two young children exposes the relationships among four families.</i>
                <br>
                A mind-bending show with a different approach to time-travel. An engaging experience from start to finish and every episode
                leaves you wanting to watch more. Pro tip: remember the characters names.

                Beyond briliant, this show offers everything a good show needs to offer. It has one of the best character arc of all times.
                Don't watch it because no other show will ever come close to this one.
